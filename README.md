# High-Power-LED-Load-Controller-2000W-DC-MOSFET-Switching-System
This project presents a hardware design and embedded control system for managing a 2000W high-power DC load (LED or equivalent) using efficient MOSFET switching, regulated via a synchronous buck converter, and monitored with NTC temperature sensors.
